## Important Note To Developers
The swagger specification for CRUS is contained in the code itself, so the
api/swagger.yaml file is generated by a pre-commit hook, not modified by hand.
Please make sure set the following in your repo to make this work:

```
$ git config --local core.hookspath .githooks/
```

In order for these hooks to work, you will need to be in a python
virtual environment with this directory installed.  To set that up:

```
$ virtualenv crus_env
$ . crus_env/bin/activate
$ pip install --index-url=http://dst.us.cray.com/dstpiprepo/simple --trusted-host dst.us.cray.com .
```

Once it is set up you can enter the virtual environment any time using
the following:
```
$ . crus_env/bin/activate
```

and leave it using:

```
$ deactivate
```

When you do a commit, you will need to be in the virtual environment
or the commit will fail during swagger generation.
